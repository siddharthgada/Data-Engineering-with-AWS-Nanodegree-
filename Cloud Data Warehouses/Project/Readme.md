# ETL and Data Modeling for Music Streaming Service Project
## Introduction:
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown its user base and song database and wants to move its processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I was tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Steps
1. Create Table Schemas
- Designed schemas for fact and dimension tables using SQL.
- Defined CREATE TABLE statements in sql_queries.py.
- Implemented create_tables.py to connect to Redshift and create the tables.
- Included DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements to reset the database before creating tables.
- Created a Redshift cluster and an IAM role with S3 read access.
- Configured dwh.cfg with Redshift database and IAM role details.
- Verified table schemas using AWS Redshift Query Editor.
2. Build ETL Pipeline
- Implemented etl.py to:
  - Load raw data from S3 to Redshift staging tables.
  - Transform and insert data into fact and dimension tables.
- Tested the pipeline by running etl.py and validating data in Redshift.
3. Cleanup
- Deleted the Redshift cluster after completing the project to avoid unnecessary costs.

## Schema Design
### Fact Table
- songplays: Stores records of song play events (user activity).
### Dimension Tables
- users: Stores user information.
- songs: Stores song details.
- artists: Stores artist details.
- time: Stores timestamps of song plays.
### Justification
- Redshift Optimization: Fact-Dimension separation enables efficient columnar storage and compression.
- Join Performance: Foreign key relationships help in fast lookups.
- Query Speed: The star schema is well-suited for analytical workloads.

### ETL Pipeline Design
#### The ETL pipeline processes and loads data into Redshift in two stages:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Staging Tables <br>
- Data is extracted from S3 and loaded into staging tables using COPY for efficiency.
- Staging tables hold raw data before transformation.<br>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Load Final Tables <br>
- SQL INSERT ... SELECT queries transform and load data from staging to fact/dimension tables.
- Data cleaning and filtering occur here.
### Justification
- Scalability: Using S3 + Redshift enables fast, scalable data processing.
- Performance: COPY command speeds up large data loads compared to INSERT.
- Data Integrity: Staging tables prevent corrupt or incomplete data from reaching the final tables.
- This design ensures high performance, maintainability, and efficiency for large-scale analytics. 

## Results & Song Play Analysis
After successfully loading the data into Redshift, we can perform song play analysis to gain insights into user listening behaviour. Below are some example queries and their corresponding results. <br>

Query 2 Link: <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Data-Engineering/blob/main/Cloud%20Data%20Warehouses/Project/Queries/Query2.png>...</a> <br>
Query 2 Results Link: <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Data-Engineering/blob/main/Cloud%20Data%20Warehouses/Project/Queries/Query2Results.png>...</a> <br>
### Findings
- From Query 1: We can see the top 5 artist names that were heard the most by a single user
- From Query 2: We can see the top 5 songs heard with artist details

## Key Learning Outcomes
‚úÖ AWS Redshift: Setting up and managing a cloud-based data warehouse. <br>
‚úÖ SQL & Schema Design: Implementing a star schema with optimized queries.<br>

## How to Run the Project<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Update dwh.cfg with Redshift database and IAM role details.<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run sql_queries.py to create statements to be imported in create_table.py and etl.py files.<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run create_tables.py to create tables in Redshift.<br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Run etl.py to load and transform data.<br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify data by querying tables in Redshift Query Editor.<br>
6Ô∏è‚É£ Delete Redshift Cluster to avoid charges.<br>
